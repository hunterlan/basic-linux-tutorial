# Basic Linux tutorial


# Folder structure

In folder `tasks` you can find all tasks, that can help you to learn basic Linux. Each task folder has `README` file, with what you have to do and `Glossary` file with words explanation. Also, it might have `assets` folder, which will have images for markdown (`.md`) files and might have files that are necessary for tasks.
