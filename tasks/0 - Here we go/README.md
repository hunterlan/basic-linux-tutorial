# Introduction
Welcome to your first task in learning Linux! It's a great operating system, that is definitely not worse, than Windows. Moreover, it's obligatory to know for people, who want to be a DevOps specialist or system administrator. Also, it's recommended to know it for developers. Of course, it doesn't mean that usual person can skip it just because I mentioned only people from IT.

I'll try to explain it as simple as possible.
If some words is not familiar for you - try to look them up in [Glossary](Glossary.md).
# Task
If you want to start working in terminal and looks like a hacker in front of your friends, you need actually to install Linux. My recommendation is to use applications, that allow to create virtual machines. Of course, no one stops you to install linux on your primary machine, but in this case, only you take responsibilities for your actions.
1. Install software, called `VirtualBox`. You can download it [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). You download file from section that contains "platform packages".
2. Download installation file of Linux distribution. I recommend to start with [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/download.php), because it has some similar interface with Windows. Choose Cinnamon Edition.
3. Create virtual machine in VirtualBox setting half of RAM in your PC, half of core count and about 60GB of hard disk. Don't forget to connect the Internet!
4. Install Linux Mint on your created virtual machine! The process steps are almost same as if you install Windows.
# Optional task

During installation of Mint, try to manually create partitions, instead of creating it automatically. The one way is explained with comment [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmint/comments/17rgnww/comment/k8jmva9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
