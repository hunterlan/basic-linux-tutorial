# Introduction
You installed Linux! Well done and welcome to the world of Linux! I hope you're ready to make your first steps in this world :) However, I recommend you not to cheat (read as "use GUI"), but be obedient and do all next tasks with usage of terminal. Otherwise, why did you start this journey? :)

[Glossary](Glossary.md) will help with unknown words.
# Task
1. In your home folder (you can type `cd` to move to this folder), create folder (`mkdir` command) "linuxBest".
2. In current directory, create a file (`touch` command) "description.txt". Write some information about Linux to the created file (of course, using terminal!).
3. Move this file from current directory to "linuxBest" directory (`mv` command).
4. Download [Cat pictures.zip](https://github.com/hunterlan/basic-linux-tutorial/raw/main/tasks/1%20-%20Babysteps/assets/files/Cat%20pictures.zip), [Cat pictures 2.zip](https://github.com/hunterlan/basic-linux-tutorial/raw/main/tasks/1%20-%20Babysteps/assets/files/Cat%20pictures%202.zip) and [valuable_files.tar](https://github.com/hunterlan/basic-linux-tutorial/raw/main/tasks/1%20-%20Babysteps/assets/files/valuable_files.tar.gz) into "linuxBest" directory (`wget` or `curl` commands).
5. Unarchive `Cat pictures.zip`.
6. Unarchive `valuable_files.tar` to current directory.
7. List files in current directory (`ls` command)
8. Try to find hidden files.
9. If you found hidden files, unhide them.
10. Create in current folder "downloaded" and move all archives and unarchived files/folder to created folder (`mv` command).
11. Delete this folder (`rm` command).
